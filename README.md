# website_projects
This repository is to show my current projects that I am doing as part of my coursework for my degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics as well as to showcase my coding 
knowledge and style. This is repository is also meant to help me show that while I may not have full work experience in applying the theory I have thus far learned, I am working
in projects that test my ability to be able to make sense of the theory and make an application of it in a useful manner. For example, in my algorithms & approximation class, 
we have finished covering the graph theory and data structures chapter and are now working in implementing a linked-list program and a binary search tree. In Mathematical 
analysis, we are covering linear analysis and getting into matrix properties, and so the concurrent lab projects are at the moment linear transformations and complexity
analysis of matrix operations and linear system solving using LU decomposition. As more labs are done, I will add them and give detailed explanations within this file. Lab
problems can be found at acme.byu.edu. Feel free to contact me for any question using form found at the bottom of my webpage.
